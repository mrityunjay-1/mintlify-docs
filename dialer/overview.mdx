Welcome to the Oriserve Dialer integration docs. These pages walk you through initiating outbound calls, receiving webhook events, streaming audio (bi‑directionally) over WebSockets, and gracefully terminating calls.

## Base URL

<Snippet name="dialer-base-url" />

All requests use JSON over HTTPS. Ensure your system's clock is synchronized (e.g., via NTP) to avoid time-based discrepancies when correlating events.

## High-Level Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initiate call">POST to the Initiate Call endpoint providing user and bot phone numbers plus webhook & media stream URLs.</Step>
  <Step title="Receive webhooks">Your webhook endpoint is invoked for lifecycle events (start, terminate, etc.).</Step>
  <Step title="Establish media WebSocket">Dialer connects to your AI service (and vice versa) to exchange 8kHz mulaw audio frames.</Step>
  <Step title="Real-time interaction">Your AI processes inbound audio frames, generates responses, and can interrupt via `clearAudio`.</Step>
  <Step title="Terminate">Either party can hang up via the Hangup API or normal call flow.</Step>
</Steps>

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| callId | UUID used to correlate API responses, media frames, and webhook events. |
| Webhook | HTTP POST callback for asynchronous call lifecycle events. |
| Media Stream | Bi-directional WebSocket channel carrying base64-encoded 8 kHz mulaw audio. |
| clearAudio | Control event from AI service to request dialer to immediately stop current outbound audio playback. |

<Note>
This documentation set currently covers outbound calls (callingDirection = `OUTBOUND`).
