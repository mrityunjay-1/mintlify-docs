If you attempt to run Mintlify on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Mintlify versions

Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Mintlify. If your local preview does not align with the production version, please update the CLI:

```bash
npm mint update
```

## Validating links

The CLI can assist with validating links in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

## Deployment

If the deployment is successful, you should see the following:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/checks-passed.png" alt="Screenshot of a deployment confirmation message that says All checks have passed." style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

## Code formatting

We suggest using extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If you're a VSCode user, consider the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

## Troubleshooting

  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>

    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:
    1. Remove the currently-installed version of the CLI: `npm remove -g mint`
    2. Upgrade to Node v19 or higher.
    3. Reinstall the CLI: `npm i -g mint`

  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">
  
    Solution: Go to the root of your device and delete the `~/.mintlify` folder. Then run `mint dev` again.
